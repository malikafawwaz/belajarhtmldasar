                Inazuma is one of the seven nations in the world of Teyvat. Known as the "Nation of Eternity," it is ruled by the Electro Archon, Raiden Shogun, also known as the God of Eternity. Inazuma is heavily inspired by Japanese culture, featuring feudal-era aesthetics, traditional architecture, and a strict social hierarchy. The history and lore of Inazuma are deeply intertwined with the ideals and rule of the Raiden Shogun. The Electro Archon seeks to achieve the eternal utopia of Euthymia, where people no longer suffer from the burdens of life. To achieve this, she implemented the Vision Hunt Decree, a policy that confiscates Visions from the people of Inazuma.

                The Vision Hunt Decree reflects the Raiden Shogun's belief that Visions, the power-giving items in the game, are a fleeting illusion that binds people to their desires and suffering. By collecting and containing all Visions, she aims to create a world without pain and attachments. However, this policy has led to unrest and resistance among the people of Inazuma. The Crux Fleet, led by Beelzebul, stands as a resistance group opposing the Vision Hunt Decree and fighting for freedom and justice. They aim to protect the Vision Bearers, those whose Visions have been confiscated, and challenge the rule of the Raiden Shogun.

                The city of Inazuma is divided into six regions, each governed by a different ruler known as a Bakufu. These Bakufus are loyal to the Raiden Shogun and enforce her policies. The regions are Narukami Island, Kannazuka, Yashiori Island, Tatarasuna, Watatsumi Island, and Seirai Island.

                Inazuma is also known for its strong belief in the Sakura Blooms, beautiful flowers that are said to be imbued with the power of eternity. The Sakura Blooms are closely associated with the Raiden Shogun and are seen as symbols of her rule and the pursuit of Euthymia.
